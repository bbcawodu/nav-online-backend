## System Personae
- As the Smart Help Desk application, an HTTP server with login based user authentication, I provide a web based
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows Presence Health Stakeholders to view consumer intent, utilization, and
capacity data collected by the patient assist plugin installed on the Presence Health website. I obtain the intent,
utilization, and capacity data for the GUI from the HTTP REST endpoints provided by the Patient Assist Browsing Data
HTTP server.

    ### Acceptance Stories
    - Acceptance stories for Smart Help Desk application.

        #### Scenario 1: Smart Help Desk is visited without authorized login credentials.
        - When the Smart Help Desk application is visited without authorized login credentials, the application redirects
        the user to a landing page that instructs the user to contact a Care Advisor admin to obtain valid login
        credentials.
        
        #### Scenario 2: Smart Help Desk is visited with authorized login credentials.
        - When the Smart Help Desk application is visited with authorized login credentials, the application makes GET
        requests to the following HTTP endpoints to obtain the data to populate the GUI.
        
            - HTTP REST Endpoint: Browsing Session Data - Presence Health (IN TEST)
                - [Browsing Session Data HTTP REST Endpoint README](../../backend_server_api_documentation/presence_health/HTTP_server_API/presence_browsing_session_data_HTTP_REST_endpoint_README.md)
                - This HTTP endpoint provides the API to read/query from the Browsing Session Data Table for Presence Health.
                    - The Smart Help Desk application makes a request to this endpoint with parameters for the desired time
                    period and a parameter specifying to only include rows with relations to a presence_conversation_workflow_snapshot
                    table row. The data is used as the numerator for the clickthrough rate, eg. browsing sessions that started a conversation.
                    The number of objects is totaled to obtain total cases. There is a key for total number of purchased
                    cases for this time period.
                    - The Smart Help Desk application makes another request to this endpoint with parameters for the desired time
                    period. The data is used as the denominator for the clickthrough rate, eg. total browsing sessions started
                    by the patient assist tool.
